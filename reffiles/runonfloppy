you will have to delete the .git, and .github folders,
also delete reffiles and readme.me

floppy needs to be ext2 to allow execution
#WARNING, DOING THIS WILL DELETE ALL FILES ON TARGET DRIVE,#
#MAKE SURE THAT THE TARGET IS IN FACT A FLOPPY DRIVE       #
#I AM NOT REPONSIBLE FOR YOU DELETING YOUR ROOT DRIVE      #
#FOR A DUMB COMPATABLILITY JOKE                            #
sudo shred -n1 -v /dev/<floppy dev>

sudo mkfs -t ext2 /dev/<floppy device> 1440
you will have to manually mount your floppy with -o exec option
then you should be able to play the game with from floppy!!!
might definatly break, especially if you change rooms too quickly,
especially over serial...
